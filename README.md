HaSi-ScratchBoard
=================

Firmware to the HaSi style ScratchBoard connecting Scratch and the outside world.
Intended for ARDUINO boards (initially UNO) together with the Adafruit Industries
Arduino Motor Shield v2.

The board can collect analogue and digital data and control analogue, digital date
as well as driving servos, dc drives or stepper according to the MotorShield.
Data transfer is done as serial data (maybe via COM or USB) to a PC running either
cratch, BYOB or Snap!. On PC side an IP/serial software interface is necessary to
transfer data between local IP network and (virtual) serial port.
